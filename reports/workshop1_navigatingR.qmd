# Workshop 1 Navigating R

```{r}
#Do some stuff
#Without "#" symbol it will produces error because "Do some" is not a function or an assigned object

5*5 #Simple calculator stuff
```

## Storing Data Objects

```{r}
x <- 24 # <- symbol assigns integer value of 24 to x
y <- 3 # assigns 3 to y

x*y # equals 72

z <- x*y
z # running this will show the value assigned to z and also =72
```

# Activity 1

How many miles did I drive on a road trip?

```{r}
miles <- 1000
hours <- 15
mph <- miles/hours
mph
```
